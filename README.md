# image-search-using-NearestNeighbors

<ol>
  <li>Used pre-trained model ResNet50 and the model has been trained on the entire ImageNet dataset</li>
  <li>And above this model i trained my own dataset</li>
  <li>For finding nearest image i used NearestNeighbors machine learning model</li>
</ol>

# It can be optimized using `ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)`.
